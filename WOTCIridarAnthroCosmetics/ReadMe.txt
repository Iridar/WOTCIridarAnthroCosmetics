[WOTC] Anthro Cosmetics Redux

This mod is a rework of [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2521798660][WOTC] Anthro Cosmetics[/url][/b] by [b]Cobalt Owl[/b]. Visit the original mod for in-game screenshots!

Just like the original, this mod adds cosmetic body parts that make soldiers look like anthropomorphic animals.[list]
[*] Available species for soldiers: Tiger, Leopard, Cheetah, Wolf, Fox, Hyena.
[*] Available species for faction heroes: Rat.
[*] Anthro heads are available as faces under Race 0.
[*] Anthro arms are not added separately. Whenever you select an Anthro head, the mod will automatically update skin material on any arms that have exposed skin visible. This feature may or may not work for mod-added arms.
[*] Anthro legs are available for all base game armors.
[*] Anthro tails are available in Thighs, Shins and Torso Deco slots for all armors.
[*] The mod also adds some Facepaints and Tattoos that go well with anthro heads.
[*] Additionally, the mod includes a character pool file with anthro uniforms that can be used by [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2664422411][WOTC] Iridar's Appearance Manager[/url][/b]. One uniform per species per gender, 18 in total. Each uniform is set up for the three basic armor tiers: kevlar, plated and powered.

[h1]KNOWN ISSUES[/h1]

Small cosmetic issue: whenever you replace an anthro head with a human head, the exposed skin material on arms will look incorrect until the character's appearance is loaded the next time.

[h1]REQUIREMENTS[/h1]
[list]
[*] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1134256495]X2 WOTC Community Highlander[/url][/b] is required.
[*] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2146403415][WOTC] Invisible Body Parts For All (v1.1)[/url][/b] - not a hard requirement, but some form of "invisible deco" mod is highly recommended, otherwise all your soldiers will be forced to use anthro tails all the time.
[*] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=629368512]More skin colors[/url][/b] - not a hard requirement, but some mod that adds more vibrant skin colors is highly recommended.
[/list]

[h1]COMPANION MODS[/h1]
[list]
[*] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2664422411][WOTC] Iridar's Appearance Manager[/url][/b] - required if you'd like to take advantage of the character pool file with anthro uniforms. Lets you "convert" any regular soldier into an anthro with a few clicks. An "Anthro Uniform" preset is added for your convenience.
[*] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1707030670][WOTC] Clean Soldier Generation[/url][/b] - prevents soldiers from being generated with mod-added body parts, including anthro or invisible body parts.
[*] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1147128235]WotC Customize Soldier Size[/url][/b] - more customization for your anthro soldiers.
[/list]

[h1]Differences from the original mod[/h1]
[list]
[*] Fixed the freeze spike when anthro cosmetics were appearing on the screen for the first time each game start.
[*] Assets are now cooked, optimizing mod size and loading times.
[*] All body parts are now properly named and are marked by an icon.
[*] All anthro legs are now consistently tied to kevlar/plated/powered armor they fit with.
[*] All tails are now consistently available as Thigh, Shin and Torso Deco cosmetics for all armors.
[*] All anthro heads now have whiskers.
[*] Anthro Arms have been removed. Instead, the mod will automatically replace the skin material of any arms that have exposed skin visible.
[*] All rat cosmetics are now available to all faction heroes, not just Reapers. Anthro cosmetics are now available only to regular soldiers.[/list]

I'd love to make all anthro cosmetics available to both soldiers and faction heroes, but they use different kinds of torso armor, so either you would have to deal with gaps, or I would have to make faction hero armor torso available to soldiers, and soldier torsos to faction heroes, and I don't like either solution.

This mod does not contain any new body parts, it just fixes and rearranges the ones set up by [b]Cobalt Owl[/b] for the original mod. Ideally this should have been an update to the original mod, and not a separate upload, but the author wouldn't reply to my attempts to communicate. Please go give a thumbs up to the original mod!

[h1]COOKED ASSETS[/h1]

Thanks to Xymanek, this mod's packages are cooked to reduce their size and improve loading times. However, Unreal Editor is unable to open cooked packages, so if for whatever reason you need to inspect this mod's packages, you can find the uncooked version of the mod on [b][url=https://github.com/Iridar/WOTCIridarAnthroCosmetics]GitHub[/url][/b].
